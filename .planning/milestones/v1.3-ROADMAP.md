# v1.3 UI Redesign — Shipped 2026-02-24

**Goal:** Transform the visually plain app into a polished, consumer-grade dark-themed PWA with glassmorphism, gradients, micro-interactions, and Inter font — inspired by Apple's design principles.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Design System Foundation** — Self-hosted Inter font via @fontsource for offline PWA, 5 reusable utility classes (glass-card, glass-surface, gradient-primary, press-scale, animate-fade-in), prefers-reduced-motion global reset
2. **Glassmorphism Throughout** — Frosted glass treatment on TabBar, SubtotalBar, all row cards (PersonRow, ItemRow, HistoryRow, AssignmentRow), PersonCard, PaymentSection, Toast, UndoToast, ReloadPrompt, RoundingFooter, hint banner
3. **SVG Tab Icons** — 5 inline SVG icons (clock, people, receipt, linked-nodes, pie-chart) above tab labels, zero bundle cost
4. **Gradient + Press-Scale System** — Blue-to-violet gradient on all primary buttons, green gradient on UPI button, press-scale micro-interaction on 18+ interactive elements
5. **Redesigned Screens** — OnboardingScreen with gradient hero, app icon, and feature highlights; ErrorBoundary with red-tinted gradient hero; 6 empty states with decorative colored icons
6. **Polished Notifications** — Glass-card toasts with slide-up animation, gradient Update button on ReloadPrompt, enlarged bill total (text-2xl font-bold)

## Phases

### Phase 13: Design System Foundation (2 plans)
- Plan 01: Design Tokens & Utility Classes (4 tasks: font install, @theme block, utility classes, reduced-motion reset + App.css delete)
- Plan 02: AppShell Layout Adjustments (2 tasks: background gradient tint, bottom padding pb-20)

### Phase 14: Layout + Glass System (2 plans)
- Plan 01: TabBar SVG Icons + Glass Styling (2 tasks: inline SVG icons for 5 tabs, glass-surface + min-h-14)
- Plan 02: SubtotalBar Glass + PersonCard Glass (3 tasks: SubtotalBar glass-surface + tracking-tight, PersonCard glass-card + drawer border, performance exit gate)

### Phase 15: Component Redesign (2 plans)
- Plan 01: Row Cards + List Spacing (5 tasks: PersonRow, ItemRow, HistoryRow, AssignmentRow, PaymentSection glass-card + 4 panel list spacing)
- Plan 02: Inputs, Toggles + Buttons (7 tasks: 8 text inputs bg-white/5 + focus:ring, 3 toggle controls glass + gradient, primary/secondary/copy buttons gradient + press-scale, regression verification)

### Phase 16: Screens + Polish (2 plans)
- Plan 01: Screens Redesign (3 tasks: OnboardingScreen gradient hero, ErrorBoundary gradient hero, 6 empty state icons)
- Plan 02: Polish (6 tasks: Toast glass-card + slide-up, UndoToast glass-card + slide-up + press-scale, ReloadPrompt glass-card + gradient button, SummaryPanel bill total + glass hint, RoundingFooter glass-card, regression verification)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Self-host Inter via @fontsource-variable/inter | Google Fonts CDN silently breaks offline in installed PWA |
| Glass utilities via Tailwind CSS 4 @utility directive | Required for variant support (not @layer utilities) |
| Animation keyframes in @theme {} in CSS | tailwind.config.js deprecated in v4 |
| Blur budget: max 4 simultaneous, max 12-16px radius | Performance budget for mobile devices |
| Inline SVG over lucide-react for tab icons | Zero bundle cost, full control, only 5 icons needed |
| Animate only transform + opacity (compositor-only) | Never box-shadow, height, padding, margin — avoids layout thrash |
| Animate individual cards only, not panel containers | AppShell keeps all panels mounted via CSS hidden |

## Audit

- 30/30 requirements verified against source code
- 29/30 cross-phase wiring verified (1 orphaned token: animate-fade-in — defined but unused)
- 6/6 integration checks passed
